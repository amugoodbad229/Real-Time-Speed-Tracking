        "It is a newly proposed attention-centric variant of the YOLO family that focuses on incorporating efficient attention mechanisms into the backbone while preserving real-time performance. Instead of relying heavily on CNN-based architectures like its predecessors, YOLOv12 introduces a simple yet powerful “area attention” module, which strategically partitions the feature map to reduce the quadratic complexity of full self-attention. It also adopts residual efficient layer aggregation networks (R-ELAN) to enhance feature aggregation and training stability, especially for larger models. These innovations, together with refinements such as scaled residual connections and a reduced MLP ratio, enable YOLOv12 to harness the benefits of attention (e.g., better global context modeling) without sacrificing speed.\n",

        "Compared to prior YOLO iterations (e.g., YOLOv10, YOLOv11, and YOLOv8), YOLOv12 achieves higher detection accuracy with competitive or faster inference times across all model scales. Its five sizes—N, S, M, L, and X—range from 2.6M to 59.1M parameters, striking a strong accuracy–speed balance. For instance, the smallest YOLOv12-N surpasses other “nano” models by over 1% mAP with latency around 1.6 ms on a T4 GPU, and the largest YOLOv12-X achieves 55.2% mAP, comfortably outscoring comparable real-time detectors such as RT-DETR and YOLOv11-X . By matching or exceeding state-of-the-art accuracy while remaining fast, YOLOv12 represents a notable step forward for attention-based real-time object detection.\n",
